### Project description 
The automobile industry is an evolving segment in the economy and as a data analyst I am tasked with optimizing product development decisions for a car manufacturer, focusing on maximum
profit while meeting consumer demand, this analysis delves into the intricate relationship between car features and other variables. The goal is to use the data analysis techniques like regression analysis and market segmentation using different visualizations. The main aim is to enhance the market competitiveness and long-term profitability.

### Data source 
The dataset of this project is the Car_data.csv file which was collected and made available on Kaggle by Cooper Union, a private college located in New York City. The given dataset was later cleaned and attributed with the required data.

### Tools

### Data analysis
To get the best outcome of the data analysis some techniques such as regression analysis, pivot tables, sensitivity analysis, optimization, and time series analysis were required to perform the tasks,

1.	How does the popularity of a car model vary across different market categories?

  ![T_1-1](https://github.com/esmdsuhail/Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability/assets/142283402/f790d77c-3320-4a91-a8ac-9876d11d8649)

  ![T_1-2](https://github.com/esmdsuhail/Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability/assets/142283402/156bd0b6-6138-4d0c-9404-5a97dea49bbe)

From the charts, the model of the car and its popularity maintain a strategic relationship with the market category as the model of the car can decide the popularity of the car and vice versa but the market category finally decides about both variables


2.  What is the relationship between a car's engine power and its price?

The Engine HP and the car price Are proportional to each other, from the chart we can see that with the increase in the engine power, the price also increases.
But most of the buyers stay in the range of 200 – 500 engine power and price range of 50k - 500k.


3.	Which car features are most important in determining a car's price?

  ![T_3](https://github.com/esmdsuhail/Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability/assets/142283402/6ba99216-d67b-4145-870f-a6c32c20dad4)

From the above charts, the two variables that can be used more to determine the car price are Engine cylinder and Engine HP. 
This analysis has also been done through regression analysis and to verify it charts are prepared
This regression analysis shows which of the variables has a strong bond/ positive relation with the price of the car.


4.	How does the average price of a car vary across different manufacturers?

   ![T_4](https://github.com/esmdsuhail/Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability/assets/142283402/7cfba1fc-aa3a-420a-9043-40885be5f0cd)

The cars can be segmented according to their fields like luxury, cost-effective(middle segment)..etc from the above chart


5.	What is the relationship between fuel efficiency and the number of cylinders in a car's engine?

   ![T_5](https://github.com/esmdsuhail/Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability/assets/142283402/5a2c02ad-5c04-4a44-8424-dbf76bca3ec9)

With the increase in the cylinders of the engine, the fuel efficiency also decreases.


### Dashboard Building from analysis
1. How does the distribution of car prices vary by brand and body style

   ![D_1](https://github.com/esmdsuhail/Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability/assets/142283402/23b0c509-bfae-4b94-bca4-dfc088b23e47)

The sedan, 4DR SUVs, and Coupe are the top 3 with high prices by brand to body style


2.	Which car brands have the highest and lowest  average MSRPs, and how does this vary by body style?

   ![D_2](https://github.com/esmdsuhail/Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability/assets/142283402/ff7a5b48-d6b7-4fee-bbae-473b0b8a26cf)

Average MSRP by Body style with Highest Bugatti coupe and Lowest Plymouth in all body styles.


3.	How does the different feature such as transmission type affect the MSRP, and how does this vary by body style? 

![D_3](https://github.com/esmdsuhail/Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability/assets/142283402/5f5c3a09-695c-4177-92a0-378eaed6e310)

The automated manual shows a greater range in price than the other types of transmission


4.	How does the fuel efficiency of cars vary across    different body styles and model years?

   ![D_4](https://github.com/esmdsuhail/Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability/assets/142283402/6f096431-026e-4804-8108-bea2b8c2bc5e)

The MPG for cars has been increasing with time for all brands and all types of car


5.	How do the car's horsepower, MPG, and price vary across different Brands?

   ![D_5](https://github.com/esmdsuhail/Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability/assets/142283402/a30cca3c-fad5-4223-bacc-ca8bdc22b783)

Brand’s Car HP and MPG The Bugatti has the highest engine power cars but the Tesla has the highest MPG cars.

### Conclusion
The comprehensive analysis of the car features and their impact on the price and profitability of cars was demonstrated by this project. The interactive dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to explore the key insights that help the car manufacturer make informed decisions related to pricing, product development, and market strategy.
